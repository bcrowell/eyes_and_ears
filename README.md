Eyes and Ears
=============

Eyes and Ears is a book of melodies for use in practicing
sight-singing. You can download it for free. It currently contains
about 400 melodies, arranged systematically for education. So far,
I've concentrated on assembling a body of relatively easy material
that would be sufficient for the first semester or two of a
college-level musicianship course. There is a small amount of didactic
text, but if you're going to use the book for self-instruction, you'll
need some background in basic music theory, and preferably access to
someone knowledgeable to provide guidance.
